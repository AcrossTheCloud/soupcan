# wiawbot-browser-extension

### A cross-browser extension for Twitter to bring [@WhatIsAWomanBot](https://twitter.com/WhatIsAWomanBot) features into your browser. Authored by [@bethylamine](https://twitter.com/bethylamine), with help from [@VehpuS](https://twitter.com/VehpuS).

## Features

* Highlight users on WhatIsAWomanBot's transphobe database

## Future Features

* Be able to highlight hashtags / report transphobic hashtags
* Hide media/tweets from transphobes behind interstitials (prevent shock posting)
* Add trans-supportive library tool to provide you with relevant trans-supportive information you can reply with quickly
* Auto-suggest debunking sources

If you have any cool ideas, please pop a message into the **Issues** tab, or message me, [@bethylamine](https://twitter.com/bethylamine), on Twitter.

## How to install

1. Download the repository and save it somewhere.
2. Search for how to load an unpacked extension in your browser of choice, then select the `manifest-v3` directory as the extension.

## Conflicts

The extension works while Shinigami Eyes is installed, but for the best experience, disable Shinigami Eyes while using this extension.
